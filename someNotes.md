so far, docker makes configuration easier, and works as a local server host. It utilises the images, creates environment in the docker.  In the meantime, docker can run things automatically by setting docker file, and docker compose. 

so, it can host database postgres, we have learned how to run postgres and pdAdmin toghther with docker. 

also, it can host airflow, a data ingestion pipeline management package, so, we can use airflow to manage and schedule the whole data ingestion (upload data to gcp or local postgres)

last, gcp is google cloud platform, like aws, it can provide google cloud storage working as data lake, which contains raw data, and also provides bigquert working as a data warehouse, which contains refined data. Terraform is a tool to define, preview and deploy cloud infrastructure using code. 

overall, it's a industry standard workflow.
